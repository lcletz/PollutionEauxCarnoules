# Folder "Data_Imputations" description

This folder contains various .Rmd files that are needed to test imputation methods and impute missing datas in our database.
We have tested the classical missing values' methods like Mean, Neighbor or Hot-Deck, 
an already pre-computed method from the package imputeTS 
and also a more precise and time-consuming method named GAMMs (Generalized Additive Mixed Models) that will possibly get us our last and best imputation results.
